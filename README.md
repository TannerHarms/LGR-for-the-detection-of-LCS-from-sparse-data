# Lagrangian Gradient Regression Demonstration

The code contained in this repository is associated with the paper **[Lagrangian Gradient Regression for the Detection of Coherent Structures from Sparse Trajectory Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10994) **by Harms, Brunton, and McKeon (2023).

Demonstrations of the methods developed are presented in the Jupyter notebooks in the main folder.   The algorithms and associated utilities used in the notebooks are contained in the `Flows` and `LGR` folders.  Users who wish to test the methods on their own data may do so by following the examples provided in the notebooks.
